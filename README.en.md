## Jev / System One Model

Most LLMs generate long-form text sequentially token-by-token, mimicking human "slow thinking (System 2)."

However, in backend decision-making workflows such as automated routing, triage, and filtering, what systems truly require is not deliberate conversational commentary, but **instant answers** accompanied by **strictly typed, reliable probability distributions**.

`sokuto` is an inference engine designed to execute the **System One Model (an intuitive, deterministic, high-speed decision model)** advocated by TypeSafe AI completely offline within a native Japanese linguistic environment (powered by ModernBERT-ja backbones).

- **Zero Text Generation**: Because no text is generated, token-dependent latency explosion and timeouts are physically impossible.
- **Elimination of Schema & Parse Errors**: Outputs are constrained a priori to three core primitives: `Choice` (single selection from multiple options), `Score` (ordinal scale evaluation such as 1–5), and `Noul` (binary Yes/No probability), eliminating JSON parsing failures and schema violations by 100%.
- **Hallucination Elimination & Probability Calibration**: Through post-hoc calibration based on strictly proper scoring rules (RLCD / temperature scaling), model output probabilities faithfully mirror true empirical confidence.
- **Helmholtz Free Energy OOD Safety Valve**: Instantly detects undefined, out-of-domain (OOD) inputs using Helmholtz free energy, enabling automated rejection or escalation.

## Why This Project?

### 1. Operational Realities: Excessive Quality, Latency, and Cost of Autoregressive LLMs

In modern enterprise workflows (e.g., customer support auto-triage, fraud detection in transaction/access logs, compliance checks), what models are repeatedly tasked to deliver is not polite chat replies, but **"strictly typed decisions (categories, scores, booleans) and trustworthy probabilities in milliseconds."**
However, deploying general autoregressive LLMs as decision engines presents fundamental operational challenges:

1. **Inflated Latency and High Operating Costs**: Sequential token generation takes hundreds to thousands of milliseconds per request, demanding expensive GPU clusters for high-throughput batch or real-time pipelines.
2. **Persistent Type Breakdown and Parse Failures**: Even with JSON Mode or strict prompt engineering, the catastrophic risk of syntax corruption or stray Markdown halting downstream services cannot be reduced to zero.
3. **Statistical Unjustifiability of Probabilities (Severe Overconfidence)**: Autoregressive LLM probabilities are not statistically calibrated, often producing >99% confidence even on incorrect predictions.
4. **Data Privacy and Air-Gapped Network Constraints**: Transmitting sensitive corporate or personal data to commercial cloud APIs (ChatGPT, Claude, TypeSafe Jev, etc.) is frequently prohibited in on-premises and air-gapped secure environments.

### 2. Engineering Decisions & Architectural Evolution

This project was established to replicate and advance the architectural principles of TypeSafe AI's "Jev" locally.

- **Adoption of Japanese-Specialized Backbone (`modernbert-ja`)**
  - **Failures Faced**: Initial prototypes using English ModernBERT or general multilingual models (inspired by prior art like Laya) suffered from severe byte over-fragmentation by non-Japanese tokenizers. This diluted self-attention, prevented stable multi-task SFT convergence, and left classification accuracy hovering in the 20% range.
  - **Technical Choice**: Fully migrated to `sbintuitions/modernbert-ja-130m` / `310m`, which require no morphological analyzer, integrate cleanly with Rust, and optimize for Japanese byte vocabularies. Initializing the special `[OP]` token using embedding centroids elevated Japanese classification accuracy to over 90%.
- **Task-Specific Geometric Losses (CORAL / ASL) & RLCD Probability Calibration**
  - **Failures Faced**: Applying post-hoc temperature scaling via Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) minimization on under-converged models caused the temperature parameter to peg at its upper bound ($T \to 5.0$) in an attempt to maximize entropy, collapsing predictions into uniform random distributions. Furthermore, applying standard multi-class Softmax to ordinal scores broke monotonicity, and binary classification (Noul) suffered from lax boundary discrimination and poor sensitivity.
  - **Inevitable Technical Choice**: Introduced label-smoothed Cross-Entropy for Choice, Cumulative Link regression (CORAL) and Ranked Probability Score (RPS) loss for Score to mathematically guarantee monotonicity, and Asymmetric Loss (ASL) for Noul. Combined with RLCD training based on strictly proper scoring rules and regularized calibration, Expected Calibration Error (ECE) was reduced to **2.61%**.
- **Permutation Equivariant Attention (SAB) & Symbol Perturbation Training**
  - **Failures Faced**: Real production log evaluations revealed severe "symbol frequency bias" (e.g., when presented with "Urgency 1: Minor" vs "Urgency 5: Outage", models were skewed toward "Urgency 1" due to the pretraining frequency of digit "1") as well as positional bias where option order affected predictions.
  - **Inevitable Technical Choice**: Engineered a custom Set Attention Block (SAB) ensuring permutation equivariance, suppressing probability fluctuations under candidate permutation to **$\le 0.65\%$**. In tandem with random symbol perturbation training and prefix normalization, symbol bias was completely eliminated.
- **Helmholtz Free Energy OOD Safety Valve**
  - **Failures Faced**: Prior discriminative models and OSS routinely suffered from "false overconfidence on undefined inputs"—assigning >90% confidence to an option even when none of the choices applied to the input (e.g., unknown inquiries or corrupt logs).
  - **Technical Choice**: Integrated a low-temperature safety circuit ($T_{\text{energy}}=0.15$) derived from Helmholtz free energy principles. This equips the system with an automated safety valve (detection rate **92.3%**) that recognizes when it "does not know," rejecting the request or escalating to higher-tier System 2 LLMs or human reviewers.
- **Pure Rust Zero-Allocation Runtime**
  - **Challenges Faced**: Python/PyTorch runtimes introduced the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and multi-gigabyte memory footprints, making predictable millisecond latencies impossible on edge or cost-effective CPU servers.
  - **Technical Choice**: Completely eliminated the Python runtime in production, architecting a zero-allocation inference pipeline using Rust + ONNX Runtime. Achieved deterministic CPU latencies of **12ms–23ms** with resident memory footprints of just **280MB–540MB**.

### 2. Distinctive Highlights of sokuto

1. **Unrivaled Practical Accuracy in Japanese Enterprise Tasks**
   - Laya and international models rely on English-centric pretraining; in Japanese, text is fractured into tiny token fragments, diluting attention and degrading accuracy.
   - `sokuto` uses `sbintuitions/modernbert-ja`, specifically tuned for Japanese syntax, delivering superior performance on enterprise tasks (Choice 90.1%, Noul 97.5%).
2. **Mathematically Grounded Bias Elimination (SAB & CORAL)**
   - Fundamental issues in prior work—such as ordinal score disruption, position 0 bias, and numerical digit biases (e.g. over-indexing on "1: Minor")—are resolved from first principles using Set Attention Blocks (SAB), CORAL cumulative links, and symbol perturbation training.
3. **Free Energy OOD Safety Valve Capable of Saying "I Don't Know"**
   - Traditional classification models and Laya force a choice with high confidence even when inputs are completely out-of-domain.
   - `sokuto` incorporates a low-temperature Helmholtz free energy circuit ($T_{\text{energy}}=0.15$), identifying undefined inputs with 92.3% accuracy to trigger rejection or escalation to System 2 LLMs and human experts.
4. **Pure Rust Zero-Allocation Infrastructure Running in Milliseconds on CPUs**
   - Eliminates the Python GIL and PyTorch runtime overhead entirely.
   - Using Rust and ONNX Runtime, it operates reliably on standard CPU servers or edge nodes with 280MB–540MB resident RAM and deterministic 12ms–23ms latencies.
